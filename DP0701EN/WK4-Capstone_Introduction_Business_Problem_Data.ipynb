    "The purpose of this project is to find optimal locations for a Chinese restaurant in London. This report is targeted at stakeholders, primarily but not limited to Chinese residing in London, British Chinese as well as new Chinese migrants who are **interest in starting and operating a Chinese restaurant business in London**.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Chinese, Chinese form 1.4% of the population of London (107,100 / 7,456,000). The Chinese population is extremely dispersed, according to Rob Lewis, a senior demographer at the Greater London Authority: **\"The reason for their thin spread all over London, is because of the idea that you want to set up a Chinese restaurant that's a little way away from the next one.\"** The statement made by Rob Lewis reinforces the applicability of the analysis discussed in this paper. We will be **using geolocation data to identify low density Chinese restaurant areas in London suitable for startup** which is a prime consideration for our stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in London, the following will outline the selection criteria:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**  \n",
    "**2. Areas with no Chinese restaurant in the vincinity**  \n",
    "**3. Near to city center of London** (assuming the first two conditions are met)\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper will use data science approach with geolocation data to identify low density Chinese restaurant areas within the boroughs of London and generate a list of suitable locations based on the criteria above. The advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible final location can be considered and chosen by stakeholders."
